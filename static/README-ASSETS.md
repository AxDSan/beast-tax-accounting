# Static Assets

This directory contains static assets that need to be replaced with client-specific content:

- **Logo files**: Replace `logo.png` and `logo-white.png` with client logos
- **Favicon**: Replace `icon.png` and files in `icons/` folder
- **Hero video**: Replace `hero.mp4` with client video
- **Background images**: Replace `about-bg.png`, `team-bg.jpg`, `specialized-bg.png`
- **Service images**: Replace images in `services/` and `products/` folders
- **Team photos**: Replace images in `team/` folder

All image paths in the code have been updated, but you need to provide the actual image files.
